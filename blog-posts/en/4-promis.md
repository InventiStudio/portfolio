description: Case study of the project we've made for Promis - French insurtech platform. The goal was to design and develop a Vue.js front-end application of insurtech platform.
---

## Goal

Promis have been selected by the main incubator in Paris - Le Village, sponsored by Le Crédit Agricole bank. It is a French insurtech platform aiming at giving the best advice to independents (lawyers, liberal doctors, freelances) in regard to their insurance needs and selling those insurances as a broker. 

The client turned to InventiStudio to help them design and develop front-end application.

## Vue.js front-end

### Responsiveness

One of the requirements was to make Promis **responsive**, as majority of users might look up the app on mobile devices. We made sure Promis looks perfect on all devices, be it **mobile**, **tablet** or **desktop**.

### SVG progress circle

The "Our Assets" section was one of the trickiest (and fun!) parts of the interface implementation. It consists of a slider on the left side and an **SVG progress circle** on the right.

“Excellent job done on Promis - congratulations! It is the first time I am outsourcing IT jobs outside of France and it was a perfect match! We had a very good communication (both written and spoken) in English, with the appropriate level of questions / feedback / reporting. InventiStudio have an awesome skills in front development (HTML / CSS / JS ES6 / Vue.js / Webpack) and there were some really tricky parts! They did a very reliable transcription of the design (Sketch files) to web pages and have excellent understanding of the instructions and challenge of the guidelines when required, with a true UI & UX design view and opinion.  

PS. We have just started a second project together. Hope it will be as good as the first one!”
