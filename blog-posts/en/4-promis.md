“Excellent job done on Promis - congratulations!
It is the first time I am outsourcing IT jobs outside of France and it was a perfect match:
- very good communication (both written and spoken) in English with the appropriate level of questions / feedback / reporting,
- awesome skills in front development (HTML / CSS / JS ES6 / Vue.js / Webpack) and there were some really tricky parts!,
- very reliable transcription of the design (Sketch files) to web pages,
- excellent understanding of the instructions and challenge of the guidelines when required with a true UI & UX design view and opinion.  

We have just started a second project together. Hope it will be as good as the first one!”
