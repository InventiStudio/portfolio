## The goal was to design and develop a Vue.js front-end of insurtech platform

Promis is a French insurtech platform aiming at giving the best advice to independents (lawyers, liberal doctors, freelances) in regard to their insurance needs and selling those insurances as a broker. They have been selected by the main incubator in Paris - Le Village, sponsored by Le Crédit Agricole bank.

We provided UI & UX design and Vue.js front-end development services.

“Excellent job done on Promis - congratulations! It is the first time I am outsourcing IT jobs outside of France and it was a perfect match! We had a very good communication (both written and spoken) in English, with the appropriate level of questions / feedback / reporting. InventiStudio have an awesome skills in front development (HTML / CSS / JS ES6 / Vue.js / Webpack) and there were some really tricky parts! They did a very reliable transcription of the design (Sketch files) to web pages and have excellent understanding of the instructions and challenge of the guidelines when required, with a true UI & UX design view and opinion.  

PS. We have just started a second project together. Hope it will be as good as the first one!”
